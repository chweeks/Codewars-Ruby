#Description:
#Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn that

#accepts the name of a programmer, and
#returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.
#The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, 
#which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.

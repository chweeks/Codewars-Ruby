#Description:
#In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

#Example:

#makeNegative(1); return -1
#makeNegative(-5); return -5
#makeNegative(0); return 0
#Notes:

#The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
#Zero (0) can't be negative, see examples above.

def makeNegative(num)
  num <= 0 ? num : num*(-1)
end

#Description:
#Create a function with two arguments that will return a list of length (n) with multiples of (x).

#Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

#Return the results as an array (or list in Python or Haskell.)

#Examples:

#count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
#count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

def count_by(x, n)
  (1..n).map {|i| i*x}
end

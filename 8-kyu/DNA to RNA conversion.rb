#Description:
#Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems.
#It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').

#Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells.
#RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine.
#In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

#Create a funciton which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

#For example:

#DNAtoRNA("GCAT") returns ("GCAU")

def DNAtoRNA(dna)
   dna.gsub("T","U")

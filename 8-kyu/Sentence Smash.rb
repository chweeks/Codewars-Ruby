#Description:
#Sentence Smash

#Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
#You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word.
#Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

#Example

#words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']
#smash(words)  returns "hello world this is great"

def smash(words)
words.join(" ")
end

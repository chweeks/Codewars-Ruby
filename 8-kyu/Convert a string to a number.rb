#Description:
#We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

#Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

#Examples

#string_to_number "1234"  == 1234
#string_to_number "605"   == 605
#string_to_number "1405"  == 1405
#string_to_number "-7"    == -7

def string_to_number(s)
  s.to_i
end

#Description:
#Who likes keywords? Nobody likes keywords, so why use them?

#You know what keyword I use too much? if! We should make a function called _if, 
#with its arguments as a logical test and two functions/lambdas, 
#where the first function is executed if the boolean is true, 
#and the second if it's false, like an if/else statement, 
#so that we don't have to mess around with those nasty keywords! 
#Even so, It should support truthy/falsy types just like the keyword.

def _if(bool, ifTrue, ifFalse)
bool ? ifTrue.call : ifFalse.call
end

#Description:
#Let's imagine we have a popular online RPG. A player begins with a score of 0 in class E5. A1 is the highest level a player can achieve.

#Now let's say the players wants to rank up to class E4. To do so the player needs to achieve at least 100 points to enter the qualifying stage.

#Write a script that will check to see if the player has achieved at least 100 points in his class. If so, he enters the qualifying stage.

#In that case, we return, "Well done! You have advanced to the qualifying stage. Win 2 out of your next 3 games to rank up.".

#Otherwise return, False/false (according to the language n use).

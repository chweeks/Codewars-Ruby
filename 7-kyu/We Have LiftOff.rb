#Desciption:
#You have an array of numbers 1 through 10 (JS: 1 through 10 or less). 
#The array needs to be formatted correctly for the person reading the countdown of a spaceship launch.

#Unfortunately, the person reading the countdown only knows how to read strings. 
#After the array is sorted correctly make sure it's in a format he can understand.

#Between each number should be a space and after the final number (1) should be the word 'liftoff!'

#Example:

# Given
#instructions = [8,1,10,2,7,9,6,3,4,5]
# Should return
#"10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!"

def liftoff(instructions)
	instructions.sort.reverse.join(" ")+" liftoff!"
end

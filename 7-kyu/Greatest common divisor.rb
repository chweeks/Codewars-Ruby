#Description:

#Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. 
#The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.

#The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, 
#so the the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

def mygcd(x,y)
  y == 0 ? x : mygcd(y, x%y)

#Description:
#As a part of this Kata, you need to find the length of the sequence in an array, 
#between the first and the second occurance of a specified number.

#For example, for a given array arr

#[0, -3, 7, 4, 0, 3, 7, 9]
#Finding length between two 7s like

#{}lengthOfSequence([0, -3, 7, 4, 0, 3, 7, 9], 7)
#would return 5.

#For sake of simplicity, there will only be numbers (positive or negative) in the supplied array.

#If there are less or more than two occurances of the number to searched for, return 0.

def length_of_sequence(arr,n)
 arr.count(n) == 2 ? arr.rindex(n) + 1 - arr.index(n) : 0

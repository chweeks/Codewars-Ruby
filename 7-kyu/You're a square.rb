#Description:
#A square of squares

#You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
#And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

#However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. 
#Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! 
#If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! 
#That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

#Task

#Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

#In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; 
#in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

 x < 0 ? false : Math.sqrt(x) % 1 == 0

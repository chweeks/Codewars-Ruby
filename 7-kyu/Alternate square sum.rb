#Description:
#Write a method alternate_sq_sum (JS: alternateSqSum ) 
#that takes an array of Integers as Input and finds the sum of squares 
#of the elements at even positions (i.e 2nd 4th 6th etc etc elements) 
#and the rest of the elements at odd Position (i.e 1st 3rd etc elements) 
#without squaring them (the odd ones) thus completing whole array.

#NOTE:

#Elements at EVEN POSITION need to be squared, like element at index 
#( assuming starting index of an array in language to be 0 ) 1,3,5,7.. etc 
#because 1st elements will be at 1st position (though it would have 0 as its index).
#For Example:

#alternate_sq_sum([11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) should return 379
#Explanation:

#elements at indices 0, 2, 4 are 11, 13, 15 and they are at odd positions as 11 is at position 
#1, 13 is at position 3 and 15 at 5.

#elements at indices 1, 3 are 12 and 14 and they are at even position. 
#So we need to add 11, 13, 15 as they are and square of 12 and 14

#--> 11 + 13 + 15 + 12^2 + 14^2
#= 11 + 13 + 15 + 144 + 196
#= 379

#Description:
#To pass the series of gates guarded by the owls, 
#Kenneth needs to present them each with a highly realistic portrait of one. 
#Unfortunately, he is absolutely rubbish at drawing, 
#and needs some code to return a brand new portrait with a moment's notice.

#All owl heads look like this:

#''0v0''
#Such beautiful eyes! However, they differ in their plumage, which is always symmetrical, eg.:

#   VVHVAV''0v0''VAVHVV
#or

#YYAYAH8XH''0v0''HX8HAYAYY
#So Kenneth needs a method that will take a garble of text generated by mashing at his keyboard 
#(numbers and letters, but he knows how to avoid punctuation etc.) 
#for a bit and give him a symmetrical owl with a lovely little face, 
#	with a truly symmetrical plumage made of uppercase letters and numbers.

#(To be clear, the acceptable characters for the plumage are 8,W,T,Y,U,I,O,A,H,X,V and M.)

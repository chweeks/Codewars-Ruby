#Description:
#In this kata, you should calculate type of triangle with three given sides a, b and c (given in any order).

#If all angles are less than 90째, this triangle is acute and function should return 1.

#If one angle is strictly 90째, this triangle is right and function should return 2.

#If one angle more than 90째, this triangle is obtuse and function should return 3.

#If three sides cannot form triangle, or one angle is 180째 (which turns triangle into segment)
# - function should return 0.

#Input parameters are sides of given triangle. 
#All input values are non-negative floating point or integer numbers (or both).

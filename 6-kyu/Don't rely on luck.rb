#Description:
#The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.

#It will compare your guess to a random number generated in Ruby by:

#(Kernel::rand() * 100 + 1).floor

#You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.

#"The power to define the situation is the ultimate power." - Jerry Rubin

#Good luck!
